Introduction to Document Processing

This is a sample document that contains multiple paragraphs and sections to test the document processing pipeline functionality.

Chapter 1: Overview
Document processing is a crucial component of modern RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems. It involves extracting text from various file formats, cleaning the content, and breaking it down into manageable chunks for further processing.

Chapter 2: Implementation Details
The pipeline supports multiple file formats including PDF, DOCX, and plain text files. Each format requires specialized processing to extract the textual content effectively.

Key features include:
- Multi-format support (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- Configurable chunking with overlap
- Text cleaning and normalization
- Comprehensive error handling
- REST API endpoints for integration

Chapter 3: Configuration Options
Users can configure chunk size and overlap parameters to optimize the text processing for their specific use case. The default settings work well for most applications, but customization is available when needed.

Conclusion
This document processing pipeline provides a robust foundation for building enterprise-grade RAG systems with reliable text extraction and preprocessing capabilities.
